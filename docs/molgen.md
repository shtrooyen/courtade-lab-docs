## ScCMB2 protein production and purification

Always sterilise the bench and use the burner to work in sterile environment when handling cells. 

### Pre-culture
-	Always use burner, sterilize the bench.
-	To a small autoclaved shake flask, add 5 mL 1xLB and 5 µL kanamycin (50 µg/mL total concentration kanamycin). Kanamycin stock: 50 mg/mL. 
-	Add a small amount of cells from the -80°C freezer to the shake flask, using a pipette tip. 
    -	The lid can be placed with the inside down on the sterilized bench. 
-	Incubate at 37°C in the top left incubator at 37°C, 225 rpm for at least 6 h. Without aluminium foil. 

### Main culture in shaking incubator
-	Inoculate 2xLB-medium (500 mL) + kanamycin (500 uL) in a 2 L baffled shake flask, with 5 mL pre-culture (1%). 
-	Incubate overnight at 22°C, 225 rpm (without aluminium foil). Incubator must be booked. 

### Inducing the gene
-	Place the flasks on ice when out of the incubator. 
-	Add 0.5 mL IPTG (0.1 mM total concentration) (inducer) to the 500 mL main culture. IPTG is found in freezer, pre-made 0.1 M tubes. 
-	Incubate at 22°C, 225 rpm for 24 h. 

### Using the LEX bubble fermenter 
-	Use a 1L bottle with blue lid for the main culture medium. 
-	Connect to power: 1) the ventilator, 2) the water bath, 3) the pump (for after). 
-	Fill the water bath so that the floating thing is all the way up (or it will stop). 
-	Set the temperature to 22°C. 
-	Prepare the air flow. Open the red valve completely. Open the black valve to the right until the pressure is at 25 psi. Press it down to lock it in place. Check for leaks. 
-	Put the main culture bottle in the water bath with a weight ring on it. Add 500 uL anti-foam (10% solution). The concentrated antifoam is in the drawer next to the fermenter, use RO water to dilute it. 
-	Inoculate 2xLB (500 mL) with the pre-culture. 
-	Put a blue lid with attached air ball loose on the bottle. Attach one of the air tubes (make sure that it is closed beforehand) by pressing it down onto the lid. 
-	Regulate the pressure by opening the valve carefully. 
-	After ca. 1h: Check that the foaming is not too much. If foam: add more anti-foam (500 uL). 
-	Next day: Check foam. Induce with IPTG directly into the bottle. (If the temperature should be changed for inducing, incubate the bottle on ice (no shaking) whilst changing the temperature of the water bath). Leave for 24 h.
-	After: 
    -	Take of the air tube. 
    -	Close the red air valve. 
    -	Release air from the system using the black valve. 
    -	Pump water from the water bath, and leave the lid open to evaporate the rest. 
    -	Turn off: temperature, ventilator and pump.
### Harvesting the culture
-	Now the cells will be destroyed, no longer very important with sterile environment. Keep on ice.
-	Transfer the culture to large centrifuge tube. 
-	Centrifuge at 5000 xg, 4°C for 10 min. The centrifuge must be booked. Balance the centrifuge to <0.1 mg difference. 
-	Discharge the supernatant, keep the pellet. 
-	The pellet can be stored at -18°C in the freezer before purification (just as it is now).


### Buffers
Buffer A: 

-	50 mM Trizma  = 3.94g 
-	300 mM NaCl = 8.77 g
-	500 mL RO-water
-	Adjust pH with NaOH to pH 8.00.
-	Sterile filtration, use 0.45 µM filters and water aspirator.

Buffer B:

-	50 mmM Trizma = 3.94g 
-	300 mM NaCl = 8.77g
-	400 mM Imidazole = 13.62g
-	500 mL RO-water
-	Adjust pH with HCl to pH 8.00.
-	Sterile filtration, use 0.45 µM filters and water aspirator.

### Preparation for purification
-	Resuspend cells in 25 mL buffer A in a 50 mL tube, and put them back on ice. 
-	Add one pellet of EDTA-free protease inhibitors (complete ultra). 
-	Use the sonicator to lyse the cells. 
    -	Keep the tube in ice to keep the temperature low.
    -	Pulse: 5 sec on, 10 sec off for time: 5 min. Total time will be 30 min. 
    -	If more than one sample, put the next on ice in the meantime. 
    -	Centrifuge the cells at 25 000 xg, 4°C for 30 min. The centrifuge must be booked. Balance the centrifuge to <0.1 mg difference. 
    -	Increase the speed to 40 000 xg if the pellet is not properly sedimented. 
-	Filter the supernatant with a syringe into a new tube. 
-	Save 20 µL of the lysate to analyse with SDS-PAGE. 

### FPLC
-	Run FPLC on the supernatant. 
    -	Column: His-Tag marked Tina. 
    -	Connect the Ni-column.
    -	Put the fraction collector in. 
    -	Put the buffers A and B on the FPLC. 
    -	Wash the pumps. 
        -	Pump A, Buff and S1 wash with buffer A.
        -	Pump B1 with buffer B.
        -	Make sure that column is placed in the correct direction. 
    -	Run the FPLC protocol. 
    -	Wash pumps with water and 20% EtOH. 
-	Remember to take out the collection rack and the empty sample tube. 

### SEC
-	The SEC column is next to the FPLC machine. 
-	The procedure consists of 3 stages, equilibration of the column with buffer, elution of the proteins and wash of the column with water and EtOH. 
-	Wash pump A, Buff and S1 with the buffer.
-	Insert the collection rack. 
-	Attach the column as follows:
    - Make sure no air bubbles enter the column. The column must be attached during buffer flow, and the sequence below must be followed in order. 
    - Start buffer flow on pump A (1 mL/min). 
    - On the column valve: switch from “Bypass” to “1”, “downstream” to make the flow go through the column. 
    - Make sure that the spring below the column has EtOH inside.
    - Open the tube to be attached at the top of the column (buffer should drip out). 
    - Open the upper tube on the column (EtOH should drip out). 
    - Attach the two tubes wet in wet. 
    - Find an adapter that fits the lower tube of the column (the same as the upper adapter). Attach it to the tube to be attached below the column. 
    - Remove the EtOH spring and attach the red part to the out-tube. 
    - Check that there is no leakage. 

-	Find and start the method FPLC_SEC_SHT (method contains equilibration and sample elution). 
-	Attach the sample on S1 and check that there are no bubbles in the tube. 
-	Check that there is enough buffer for the method, and enough MQ water and EtOH (20%) for the washing afterwards.
-	When the method is finished, wash the pumps with MQ water. 
-	Start the method SEC_wash_SHT, with MQ water. 
-	Wash the pumps with 20% EtOH. 
-	Start the wash method again with EtOH.  
-	At the end of the EtOH wash, or during manual EtOH flow, remove the column from the FPLC. 
    - Remove the bottom tube and attach the EtOH spring. Let it fill up.
    - Remove the upper tube and seal it. 
    - Assemble the FPLC tubes as they were. 
    - Put the column back.
-	Remember to take out the collection rack and the empty sample tube. 

## SDS-PAGE
All components of SDS page are from GenScript, found [here](https://www.genscript.com/product/documents?producttype=&cat_no=M42012&catalogtype=Document-PROTOCOL&Search=Search).

-	Determine which samples from FPLC/SEC to go on the gel, take out 20 µL of each sample. 
-	Dilute the lysate.
-	Add 20 µL of LDS (from freezer) to each sample. Concentrated LDS is in the fridge. LDS is a detergent with added reductant to reduce disulfide bonds and denature the protein.
-	Heat the samples at 95°C for 5 min. 
-	Assemble the SDS-PAGE chamber with the gel (from fridge). Remember to tear off the green tape on the bottom of the gel. 
-	Fill the chamber with MES SDS buffer (sachets in cupboard added to DI water). The outer chamber can be filled with reused buffer if needed. The inner chamber must be filled completely. Make sure that the inner chamber is tight and not leaking.  
-	Remove the green plastic thing on the gel. 
-	Apply 20 µL lysate, 5 µL ladder (from freezer), and 20 µL of all samples to the wells of the SDS-PAGE gel.
-	Run the gel at 200 V, 30 min with constant voltage.

### Staining/destaining
-	On the staining machine, take out one of the membrane plates A or B. 
-	Take a filter paper from beside the machine. 
-	Separate the plastic plates of the SDS-PAGE gel with the metal tool. 
-	Rinse the gel under water and place it on the membrane so that the wells are pointing towards the hinges of the membrane holder. 
-	Place a wetted filter paper over the gel and close the holder. 
-	Put into the machine. Make sure there is enough staining and destaining liquid. 
-	Start the process. 
-	Store the gel in water. Collect the pure protein fractions from FPLC.
